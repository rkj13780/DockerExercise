Azure Repos is a set of version control tools that you can use to manage your code.
Azure Repos provides two options for version control: Git and Team Foundation Version Control (A centralized VCS).  We will use Git for our example.

Prerequisite:
You will need an Azure DevOps account (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/)

If you are already part of an organization, sign in here: https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}

You will need to have the Git CLI tools installed

==============
Create a New Project:

Provide a Name

Select> public or private


When completed, welcome page should appear.

===============

Select Repos

You repo will be empty.

If you have not previously added SSH keys, select Manage SSH keys and add your public key.


Now Select Clone to Your Computer (SSH) and copy the URL

Open a local terminal window. 

Go to the folder where you want the code from the repo stored on your computer, and run git clone, followed by the path copied from Clone URL in the previous step. 

git clone {https://YOUR_COPIED_URL}

#eg. git clone git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/john0136/liletestaci/liletestaci

#You now have an empty git directory that is tied to your remote Azure repo.

Now add your application code from 01-01 and push it to the Azure repo.

git add *.*
git commit -m 'initial code commit'
git push

Go back to your Azure DevOps repo and look at "Files"

#Dockerfile ended up as an untracked file because of no .*

git add Dockerfile
git commit -m 'add Dockerfile'
git push

Go back to your Azure DevOps repo and look at "Files" - Dockerfile is now added!

You can now share your code with other developers, in addition to locally building and Docker pushing to your Docker registry.
